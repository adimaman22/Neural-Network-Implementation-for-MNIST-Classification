# Neural-Network-Implementation-for-MNIST-Classification
This deep learning project involves designing and implementing a neural network from scratch using PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project emphasizes a deep understanding of forward and backward propagation, training neural networks, and improving performance with regularization techniques.
